      <h1 class="OtherSectionHeader">How Do We Reduce Greenhouse Gases?</h1>
      <p class="OtherSectionParagraph">
        To stop climate change, we need to stop the amount of greenhouse gases,
        like carbon dioxide, from increasing. For the past 150 years, burning
        fossil fuels and cutting down forests, which naturally pull carbon
        dioxide out of the air, has caused greenhouse gas levels to increase.
        There are two main ways to stop the amount of greenhouse gases from
        increasing: we can stop adding them to the air, and we can increase the
        Earth’s ability to pull them out of the air.<br />
        This is called <strong>climate mitigation</strong>. There is not one
        single way to mitigate climate change. Instead, we will have to piece
        together many different solutions to stop the climate from warming.
        Below are descriptions of the main methods that we can use.<br />
        Many of these solutions are already being implemented in places around
        the world. Some can be tackled by individuals, such as using less
        energy, riding a bike instead of driving, driving an electric car, and
        switching to renewable energy. Other actions to mitigate climate change
        involve communities, regions, or nations working together to make
        changes, such as switching power plants from burning coal or gas to
        renewable energy and growing public transit.

      <h1 class="OtherSectionHeader OtherSectionHeader2">
        Use less electricity.
      </h1>
      <p class="OtherSectionParagraph">
        Taking steps to use less electricity, especially when it comes from
        burning coal or gas, can take a big bite out of greenhouse gas
        emissions. Worldwide, electricity use is responsible for a quarter of
        all emissions.<br />
        Some steps that you can take to use less electricity are simple and save
        money, like replacing incandescent light bulbs with LED bulbs that use
        less electricity, adding insulation to your home, and setting the
        thermostat lower in the winter and higher in the summer, especially when
        no one is home. There are also new technologies that help keep buildings
        energy efficient, such as glass that reflects heat, low-flow water
        fixtures, smart thermostats, and new air conditioning technology with
        refrigerants that don’t cause warming. In urban and suburban
        environments, green or cool roofs can limit the amount of heat that gets
        into buildings during hot days and help decrease the urban heat island
        effect.

        Generate electricity without emissions.
      </h1>
      <p class="OtherSectionParagraph">
        Renewable energy sources include solar energy, geothermal energy, wind
        turbines, ocean wave and tidal energy, waste and biomass energy, and
        hydropower. Because they do not burn fossil fuels, these renewable
        energy sources do not release greenhouse gases into the atmosphere as
        they generate electricity. Nuclear energy also creates no greenhouse gas
        emissions, so it can be thought of as a solution to climate change.
        However, it does generate radioactive waste that needs long-term, secure
        storage.<br />
        Today, the amount of electricity that comes from renewable energy is
        growing. A few countries, such as Iceland and Costa Rica, now get nearly
        all of their electricity from renewable energy. In many other countries,
        the percentage of electricity from renewable sources is currently small
        (5 - 10%) but growing.

      <h1 class="OtherSectionHeader OtherSectionHeader2">
        Shrink the footprint of food.
      </h1>
      <p class="OtherSectionParagraph">
        Today, about a fifth of global carbon emissions come from raising farm
        animals for meat. For example, as cattle digest food they burp,
        releasing methane, a powerful greenhouse gas, and their manure releases
        the greenhouse gases carbon dioxide and nitrous oxide. And forests,
        which take carbon dioxide out of the air, are often cut down so that
        cattle have space to graze.<br />
        Eating a diet that is mostly or entirely plant-based (such as
        vegetables, bread, rice, and beans) lowers emissions. According to the
        Drawdown Project, if half the population worldwide adopts a plant-rich
        diet by 2050, 65 gigatons of carbon dioxide would be kept out of the
        atmosphere over about 30 years. (For a sense of scale, 65 gigatons of
        carbon dioxide is nearly two-years-worth of recent emissions from fossil
        fuels and industry.) Reducing food waste can make an even larger impact,
        saving about 90 gigatons of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere over 30
        years.

        Travel without making greenhouse gases.
      </h1>
      <p class="OtherSectionParagraph">
        Most of the ways we have to get from place to place currently rely on
        fossil fuels: gasoline for vehicles and jet fuel for planes. Burning
        fossil fuels for transportation adds up to 14% of global greenhouse gas
        emissions worldwide. We can reduce emissions by shifting to alternative
        technologies that either don’t need gasoline (like bicycles and electric
        cars) or don’t need as much (like hybrid cars). Using public
        transportation, carpooling, biking, and walking leads to fewer vehicles
        on the road and less greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. Cities and
        towns can make it easier for people to lower greenhouse gas emissions by
        adding bus routes, bike paths, and sidewalks.

        Reduce emissions from industry.
      </h1>
      <p class="OtherSectionParagraph">
        Manufacturing, mining for raw materials, and dealing with the waste all
        take energy. Most of the products that we buy — everything from phones
        and TVs to clothing and shoes — are created in factories, which produce
        up to about 20% of the greenhouse gases emitted worldwide.<br />
        There are ways to decrease emissions from manufacturing. Using materials
        that aren’t made from fossil fuels and don’t release greenhouse gases is
        a good start. For example, cement releases carbon dioxide as it hardens,
        but there are alternative products that don’t create greenhouse gases.
        Similarly, bioplastics made from plants are an alternative to plastics
        that come from fossil fuels. Companies can also use renewable energy
        sources to power factories and ship the products that they create in
        fuel-saving cargo ships.

        Take carbon dioxide out of the air.
      </h1>
      <p class="OtherSectionParagraph">
        Along with reducing the amount of carbon dioxide that we add to the air,
        we can also take action to increase the amount of carbon dioxide we take
        out of the air. The places where carbon dioxide is pulled out of the air
        are called carbon sinks. For example, planting trees, bamboo, and other
        plants increases the number of carbon sinks. Conserving forests,
        grasslands, peatlands, and wetlands, where carbon is held in plants and
        soils, protects existing carbon sinks. Farming methods such as planting
        cover crops and crop rotation keep soils healthy so that they are
        effective carbon sinks. There are also carbon dioxide removal
        technologies, which may be able to pull large amounts of greenhouse
        gases out of the atmosphere.
