        <h1 class="SectionHeader">How Do We Reduce Greenhouse Gases?</h1>
        <hr class="hr" />
        <p class="SectionParagraph">
          To stop climate change, we need to stop the amount of greenhouse
          gases, like carbon dioxide, from increasing. For the past 150 years,
          burning fossil fuels and cutting down forests, which naturally pull
          carbon dioxide out of the air, has caused greenhouse gas levels to
          increase. There are two main ways to stop the amount of greenhouse
          gases from increasing: we can stop adding them to the air, and we can
          increase the Earth’s ability to pull them out of the air.<br />
          This is called <strong>climate mitigation</strong>. There is not one
          single way to mitigate climate change. Instead, we will have to piece
          together many different solutions to stop the climate from warming.
          Below are descriptions of the main methods that we can use.<br />
          Many of these solutions are already being implemented in places around
          the world. Some can be tackled by individuals, such as using less
          energy, riding a bike instead of driving, driving an electric car, and
          switching to renewable energy. Other actions to mitigate climate
          change involve communities, regions, or nations working together to
          make changes, such as switching power plants from burning coal or gas
          to renewable energy and growing public transit.

        <h1 class="OtherSectionHeader SectionHeader2">Use less electricity.</h1>
        <p class="SectionParagraph">
          Taking steps to use less electricity, especially when it comes from
          burning coal or gas, can take a big bite out of greenhouse gas
          emissions. Worldwide, electricity use is responsible for a quarter of
          all emissions.<br />
          Some steps that you can take to use less electricity are simple and
          save money, like replacing incandescent light bulbs with LED bulbs
          that use less electricity, adding insulation to your home, and setting
          the thermostat lower in the winter and higher in the summer,
          especially when no one is home. There are also new technologies that
          help keep buildings energy efficient, such as glass that reflects
          heat, low-flow water fixtures, smart thermostats, and new air
          conditioning technology with refrigerants that don’t cause warming. In
          urban and suburban environments, green or cool roofs can limit the
          amount of heat that gets into buildings during hot days and help
          decrease the urban heat island effect.

          Generate electricity without emissions.
        </h1>
        <p class="SectionParagraph">
          Renewable energy sources include solar energy, geothermal energy, wind
          turbines, ocean wave and tidal energy, waste and biomass energy, and
          hydropower. Because they do not burn fossil fuels, these renewable
          energy sources do not release greenhouse gases into the atmosphere as
          they generate electricity. Nuclear energy also creates no greenhouse
          gas emissions, so it can be thought of as a solution to climate
          change. However, it does generate radioactive waste that needs
          long-term, secure storage.<br />
          Today, the amount of electricity that comes from renewable energy is
          growing. A few countries, such as Iceland and Costa Rica, now get
          nearly all of their electricity from renewable energy. In many other
          countries, the percentage of electricity from renewable sources is
          currently small (5 - 10%) but growing.

          Shrink the footprint of food.
        </h1>
        <p class="SectionParagraph">
          Today, about a fifth of global carbon emissions come from raising farm
          animals for meat. For example, as cattle digest food they burp,
          releasing methane, a powerful greenhouse gas, and their manure
          releases the greenhouse gases carbon dioxide and nitrous oxide. And
          forests, which take carbon dioxide out of the air, are often cut down
          so that cattle have space to graze.<br />
          Eating a diet that is mostly or entirely plant-based (such as
          vegetables, bread, rice, and beans) lowers emissions. According to the
          Drawdown Project, if half the population worldwide adopts a plant-rich
          diet by 2050, 65 gigatons of carbon dioxide would be kept out of the
          atmosphere over about 30 years. (For a sense of scale, 65 gigatons of
          carbon dioxide is nearly two-years-worth of recent emissions from
          fossil fuels and industry.) Reducing food waste can make an even
          larger impact, saving about 90 gigatons of carbon dioxide from the
          atmosphere over 30 years.

          Travel without making greenhouse gases.
        </h1>
        <p class="SectionParagraph">
          Most of the ways we have to get from place to place currently rely on
          fossil fuels: gasoline for vehicles and jet fuel for planes. Burning
          fossil fuels for transportation adds up to 14% of global greenhouse
          gas emissions worldwide. We can reduce emissions by shifting to
          alternative technologies that either don’t need gasoline (like
          bicycles and electric cars) or don’t need as much (like hybrid cars).
          Using public transportation, carpooling, biking, and walking leads to
          fewer vehicles on the road and less greenhouse gases in the
          atmosphere. Cities and towns can make it easier for people to lower
          greenhouse gas emissions by adding bus routes, bike paths, and
          sidewalks.

          Reduce emissions from industry.
        </h1>
        <p class="SectionParagraph">
          Manufacturing, mining for raw materials, and dealing with the waste
          all take energy. Most of the products that we buy — everything from
          phones and TVs to clothing and shoes — are created in factories, which
          produce up to about 20% of the greenhouse gases emitted worldwide.<br />
          There are ways to decrease emissions from manufacturing. Using
          materials that aren’t made from fossil fuels and don’t release
          greenhouse gases is a good start. For example, cement releases carbon
          dioxide as it hardens, but there are alternative products that don’t
          create greenhouse gases. Similarly, bioplastics made from plants are
          an alternative to plastics that come from fossil fuels. Companies can
          also use renewable energy sources to power factories and ship the
          products that they create in fuel-saving cargo ships.

          Take carbon dioxide out of the air.
        </h1>
        <p class="SectionParagraph">
          Along with reducing the amount of carbon dioxide that we add to the
          air, we can also take action to increase the amount of carbon dioxide
          we take out of the air. The places where carbon dioxide is pulled out
          of the air are called carbon sinks. For example, planting trees,
          bamboo, and other plants increases the number of carbon sinks.
          Conserving forests, grasslands, peatlands, and wetlands, where carbon
          is held in plants and soils, protects existing carbon sinks. Farming
          methods such as planting cover crops and crop rotation keep soils
          healthy so that they are effective carbon sinks. There are also carbon
          dioxide removal technologies, which may be able to pull large amounts
          of greenhouse gases out of the atmosphere.
