## About Future Nature(home)

Extreme weather events are dominating the disaster landscape in the 21st century, causing a devastating loss of life, major disruption to development and destruction of natural habitats. In the period 2000 to 2019, there were 7,348 major recorded disaster events, claiming 1.23 million lives and affecting 4.2 billion people - a sharp increase from the previous 20 years. Worse is forecast for the next 20 years and beyond.

With the global climate changing at an unprecedented rate, we are seeing dramatic effects on natural disasters around the world. Increases in air and water temperatures have led to more frequent and more intense weather events, resulting in supercharged storms with high wind speeds, more intense and prolonged droughts and wildfire seasons, and heavier precipitation and flooding.

As a result, it is making it harder to live in many parts of the world. Vulnerable communities that contribute the least to climate change are suffering from the worst consequences, including loss of life, loss of natural resources, food insecurity and displacement. Many of these communities are affected by concurrent and consecutive disasters, leaving them with little time to recover before the next shock arrives.

The recent landmark study by the UN’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) concluded it is “unequivocal and indisputable that humans are warming the planet.” UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres called it “code red for humanity”.
